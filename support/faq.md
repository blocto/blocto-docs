6.  Q: Is Blocto Wallet an Injected Wallet?



    Answer:

    Yes, for Blocto Android/iOS App, there is an in-app browser.\

7.  Q: Length error regarding signing and verifying the message.\


    Context:&#x20;

    _`I followed the instructions at: https://docs.blocto.app/blocto-sdk/javascript-sdk/evm-sdk/sign-message`_

    _`However, when verifying the message, there is an error about the length of the signature. Specifically:`_

    _`The signature after signing with Blocto's provider is 262 characters long (including 0x).`_

    _`The signature in the example (and accepted in the library) is 132 characters long (including 0x).`_



    Answer:&#x20;

    _1/ the library combines two verifications:_

    _Step 1. EOA signature_

    _Step 2. EIP1271 signature_\
    __

    _2/ The Blocto signature must fail in step 1. But it will work in step 2. The number of Blocto signature is 2, which is equal to 65\*2 bytes = 260 chars (without 0x)._

    __

    _3/ the lib (https://github.com/dapperlabs/dappauth.js/blob/master/index.js#L36) which did Step 2, can verify the signature from the private key wallet and the smart contract wallet at the same time. So you can ignore it if you only use Blocto._



    Reference:

    https://docs.blocto.app/blocto-sdk/javascript-sdk/evm-sdk/login-register\

8.  Q: Failed to recover the account that signs the data.



    Answer:

    Smart contract wallet doesn't have private key. Instead, please follow ERC1654 to verify the signature ([github](https://github.com/dapperlabs/dappauth.js)).\


## Unity SDK

1.  Q: (Android) Why is your Blocto app not returning back to my DemoApp?&#x20;

    1.  Please use the latest code from GitHub repo and download the latest version of Blocto dev app from Google Play. (screenshot as below)\
