### Flow

[Flow](https://onflow.org), built by [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), is a decentralized platform built to support the next generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them.

Flow has a few unique designs that make it particularly suitable for consumer facing dApps, such as an account system with built-in multi-sig mechanism, built-in fee subsidization and resource-oriented smart contract language [Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/getting-started-1). It also provides much better scalability than Ethereum, which is necessary for mass market adoption.

### Flow JavaScript SDK

Flow ships with a bundle JavaScript libraries including [Flow SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/sdk) and [Flow Client Library (FCL)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/fcl). With these libraries, web-based dApps can interact with Flow blockchain easily. If you're familiar with dApp development on Ethereum, they're basically the web3.js for Flow.

Flow Client Library, or FCL, defines how web-based dApps can interact with wallet providers like Blocto SDK. In the following sections, we will show you how to use Blocto wallet service in your Flow dApp.
