Blocto Android SDK supports two flows depending on whether the Blocto app is installed or not.

#### **Blocto app installed**

Based on development environment, you need to download the corresponding Blocto app for testing:

* [prod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portto.blocto) (Google Play)
* [dev](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/612815c0750fce98) (Firebase App Distribution)

#### **Blocto app not installed**

SDK would open browser using Web SDK in your dApp to use the Blocto service.
