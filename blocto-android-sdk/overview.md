# Overview

### Blocto Android SDK

> The best blockchain experience is that user doesn't even realize it's a blockchain experience.

Mobile phones have become part of our daily lives. But so far most of the dApps are still web-based applications which have poor user experience compared with native apps. Also wallet creation or management may be a stopper for dApp users, such as recovery phrase, especially for those who don't know about blockchain.

That's why we're building Blocto Android SDK so dApp developers can integrate our wallet service tightly into their dApps and improve user experience.

### Advantages

1. **Seamless on boarding**\
   Users don't have to go through the painful wallet creation process, where they get intimidated by new ideas like seed phrases, private keys, addresses, ... etc. They can learn later, as they accumulate more assets in their wallets. ([See how our mixed custodial model works](../technical-documents/key-management.md))\

2. **Freemium model made possible**\
   You can pay transaction fees for your users to provide a freemium experience. They don't have to buy crypto to pay for fees before they try out your dApp. ([See how meta-transaction works](../technical-documents/contract-wallet.md#meta-transaction))\

3. **Integrated payment**\
   Get paid easily with our payment APIs. Users can pay easily with credit cards or other crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, USDT, ... etc\

4. **Connected to Blocto App**\
   Once you've integrated with Blocto Android SDK, your users can manage their assets easily and securely through Blocto App. Your dApp can tap into the vast blockchain ecosystem instantly.\

5. **Supports multiple blockchains**\
   Blocto Android SDK supports Solana, Ethereum, Flow and a lot more to come. Blocto also helps users convert their assets across different chains.\

6. **Supports Web SDK**\
   Even if your users don't have the Blocto app installed, Blocto Android SDK integrates Web SDK that still can make the flow smoothly without any stopper.
