# Wallet Web UI v2 Upgrade

To enhance user experience and safety, we will sunset Blocto Wallet Web v.1 on October 2nd, 2023. After this date, users will _no longer have access_ to Blocto Wallet on dApps which use Wallet Web v.1 SDK. To continue providing services with Blocto Wallet, dApps need to upgrade to v.2 SDK.

By migrating to v.2, Blocto users will enjoy an enhanced and safer experience, including new features like social login. To continue using Blocto Wallet and benefit from these features, please upgrade your Blocto SDK or update the FCL URL using the following guide. The upgrade process takes approximately 15 minutes.&#x20;
