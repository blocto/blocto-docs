# Wallet Web UI v2 Upgrade

We will sunset Blocto Wallet Web v.1 on **October 2nd**, 2023. After this date, Blocto users will _no longer have access_ to dApps that have installed Wallet Web v.1 SDK. This means dApps have to upgrade the SDK version to continue providing services with Blocto Wallet. This decision is driven by our commitment to improving user experience and security. By migrating to v.2, Blocto users will enjoy an enhanced and safer experience.

To continue using Blocto Wallet and benefit from our new features (such as social login), please upgrade your Blocto SDK or update the FCL URL using the following guide. The upgrade can be normally done in **15 minutes**.



### **fcl.js:**

Please upgrade fcl.js to `1.4.0` and update URLs referring to the following migration guide: [https://docs.blocto.app/blocto-sdk/javascript-sdk/flow/migration-guide](https://docs.blocto.app/blocto-sdk/javascript-sdk/flow/migration-guide)
