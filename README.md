description: Getting started with Blocto and Blocto SDK

# ðŸ“£ Introduction

Blocto is built with two goals in mind:

1. **Make it simple for average users to use dApps**
2. **Make it simple for developers to build good dApps**

For these goals we have built:

1. [Blocto app](blocto-app/overview.md) to reduce entry barrier and improve dApp experience
2. [Blocto SDK](blocto-sdk/overview.md) to help developers build awesome dApps with minimal effort

#### Account Abstraction

Blocto wallets are built with chain-agnostic account abstraction. On chains with native account abstraction, such as [Aptos](https://aptos.dev) and [Flow](https://flow.com/), Blocto utilizes the native account system to provide account abstraction functionalities; On chains without native account abstraction, such as Ethereum, Polygon and Solana, Blocto builds uses smart contracts to achieve account abstraction. This gives Blocto wallets a lot of advantages over regular private-key wallets. To learn more about our ERC-4337 compliant wallet on Ethereum, check out[ this technical document](technical-documents/contract-wallet.md).
